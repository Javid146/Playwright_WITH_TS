Jenkins

Manually build job:

Option A - Use Local Project Path:
1. Build steps --> Add build step --> execute windows batch command

2. cd C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\PlayWright_With_TS
npm ci && npx playwright install --with-deps && npx playwright test tests/Allure  

//ci stands for “clean install” or “continuous integration” and installs all deps, 
//npx playwright install --with-deps installs all browsers
3. Build now

Option B - Use Github:
1. Click on job --> Configure --> Source Code Management --> Check Git radio btn
2. Add Repository URL. If Repo is not public add Credentials as well
Branch Specifier: */main or */master depending or project's branch name
3. Build Steps --> Add build step --> Execute Windows batch command: 
npm ci && npx playwright install --with-deps && npx playwright test tests/Allure --project=firefox
4. Apply --> Save --> Build now



Build job with parameters:
1. Cick job --> Configure --> General
2. This project is parameterized --> Add parameter --> Choice parameter

You can e.g. make parameter options for browsers and tagnames which will provide 2 dropdowns (1 for browser, 1 for tag):
a. Name: Browser
b. Choices:
firefox
webkit
chromium

a. Name: TagName
b. Choices:
UAT
DEV

3. Apply/Save
4. Windows batch command to run test will be: npx playwright test --project=%Browser% --grep=%TagName%
Whichever browser you choose before building job test will run on it. %Browser% because name of param above is Browser.
Whichever tag you add in test near test name that test will run only. E.g. from dropdown I choose DEV tag it means tests with @DEV tag will run only.





Trigger and build job:
Option 1 - Build periodically:
1. Triggers --> Build periodically --> Schedule with cron expression: e.g 15 3 * * * (every day at 3:15am)








Post-build Actions:

HTML reports:
1. Install HTML publisher plugin in Jenkins
2. Manage Jenkins --> Script console: 
System.setProperty("hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP", "")  //this allows to bypass content security policy to see test html reports on Jenkins after job build.
3. Post-build Actions --> Publish HTML reports:
a. HTML directory to archive: add full path from framework where you want report to be archived: e.g. C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\PlayWright_With_TS\playwright-report
b. Report title: any title you want. It will be displayed in Jenkins after build.
