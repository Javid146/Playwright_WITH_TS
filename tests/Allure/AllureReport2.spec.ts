/*
npm i allure-playwright@2.15.1

in config file: 
reporter: [['allure-playwright', { outputFolder: "GoogleAllureReportFolder" }]]

This will create folder called GoogleAllureReportFolder (The Raw Test Data, Not Human-Readable)
On Windows CMD:
set ALLURE_RESULTS_DIR=GoogleAllureReportFolder
npx playwright test tests/Allure  --reporter=allure-playwright

On Powershell:
$env:ALLURE_RESULTS_DIR="GoogleAllureReportFolder"
npx playwright test tests/Allure  --reporter=allure-playwright


generate report (The Generated Human-Readable Report): 
CMD: allure generate GoogleAllureReportFolder --clean
This command will create allure-report folder where you can view reports. And if folder already exists with old
report files "--clean" will overwrite them with new reports.

Open report to view:
allure open allure-report

If you define options below in config file they will be displayed on Allure report as well:
Options:
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 1,
  screenshot: 'on',
  video: 'on',
  trace: 'on'

  in order to view trace its zip needs to be downloaded from allure report and zip folder needs to be pasted on test.playwright.dev 
  to view.

How to Generate Allure Report with Playwright and allure-playwright

1. Install allure-playwright:
   npm i allure-playwright@2.15.1

2. Configure Playwright (playwright.config.ts):
   reporter: [['allure-playwright', { outputFolder: "GoogleAllureReportFolder" }]]

   This creates the folder "GoogleAllureReportFolder" containing raw test data (NOT human-readable).
   Folder name can be any

3. Run tests:
   npx playwright test tests/Allure --reporter=allure-playwright
   Allure practice tests are in Allure folder that's why we added it to command.


4. Generate human-readable Allure report:

   allure generate GoogleAllureReportFolder --clean

   - This creates the "allure-report" folder.
   - The --clean option overwrites old reports if they exist.

5. Open the Allure report in a browser:
   allure open allure-report

6. Optional config options to add in playwright.config.ts to show in Allure report:
   retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 1, //retries once if test fails
   screenshot: 'on',               //takes ss
   video: 'on',                   //takes video
   trace: 'on'                   //creates trace.zip

   Note:
   To view trace details, download the trace zip from Allure report
   and upload it to https://test.playwright.dev for visualization.
